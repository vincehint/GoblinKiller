Goblin Killer

Can you survive?
Let's see if you're a hero, or a "chicken chaser"! (Chicken Chaser? Do you chase chickens??)
Controls: W=Up A=Left S=Down D=Right

To shoot hit Enter.
Your arrows will shoot in the last direction that you moved your character,
i/e to shoot down hit the down key and then press Enter.
Each round contains a number of Goblins, or speeds.
Kill the goblins and you win the round.
Don't let them touch you though!
Goblins have notoriosly disgusting skin and you'll get icky
...and die.

This game was created by Vincent Kofstad December of 2020 out of a state of pandemic boredom. Just kidding, it's a class project. 

Goblin Killer was written in VS Code.
